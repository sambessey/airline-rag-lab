# Irregular Operations: Reaccommodation Policy

**Policy ID:** OPS-IRROPS-010  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective:** 2026-01-01  
**Region:** Global  
**Owner:** Airport Operations

## Definitions
- **IRROPS:** Delay, cancellation, misconnect, equipment change, or crew disruption.
- **Same-day:** Departure before 23:59 local time.
- **Reaccommodation:** Rebooking onto an alternate itinerary to complete travel.

## Standard Rebooking Rule
If a flight is delayed **120+ minutes** or cancelled, agents should:
1. Rebook onto the **next available flight** to the same destination.
2. Preserve **cabin** where possible (Economy → Economy, Business → Business).
3. Prefer itineraries with **≤ 1 connection** if arrival is within 6 hours of original.

## Missed Connection Handling
If the customer will miss a connection due to IRROPS:
- Prioritize itineraries that arrive the **same day**.
- If no same-day options exist, offer next-day reaccommodation + hotel guidance (see Service Recovery).

## Seat Assignment
- Keep original seat selection where possible.
- If the customer is reaccommodated to a different aircraft, assign an equivalent seat class (aisle/window preference if recorded).

## Constraints
- Do not overbook a flight beyond published capacity.
- Do not confirm a partner itinerary without validating ticketing eligibility (see Partner Guidelines).
